/*
Inheritance allows developers to create subclasses/child Class that reuse code declared already in
a superclass. Avoiding the duplication of common functionality between several
classes by building a class inheritance hierarchy can save developers a considerable
amount of time. Similarly, placing common functionality in a single superclass,
rather than duplicating the code in multiple unrelated classes,
helps prevent the same errors from appearing in multiple source-code files.
If errors occur in the common functionality of the superclass/Parent Class,
the software developer needs to modify only the superclass/Parent Class.
